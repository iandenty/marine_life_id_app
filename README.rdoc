The concept for this projects stems from my volunteering experience at a marine conservation charity. It pulls together several issues I am interested in including conservation and education technology. My app provides a platform for users to upload their photo sightings of marine wildlife, and taking a citizen science approach ( discussed with the Natural History Museum, London) allows the community to attribute identifications to the photos. The output is to engage users in marine wildlife and conservation issues but to also generate meaningful data which could have scientific applications.
